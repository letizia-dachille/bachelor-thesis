# Description

Analyzing the computation of the normal form of a module via Buchbergerâ€™s
algorithm, we compare this procedure with the Gauss and Euclidean algorithms,
and we study it as a tool for computing operations between modules. We provide
a unified treatment of the theory, in which systematic comparisons have been
developed from considerations that are not generally formalized in literature.
The work is supported by examples developed using CoCoA.
